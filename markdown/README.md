Cricket is my favourite pastime and a well-known sport. It helps me feel stronger, healthier, and more fit. It gives me a sense of self-assurance and pride in who I am. When I was seven years old, I began playing cricket.  
My love for cricket began when I was a tiny child, when I began playing with my older brother in the backyard of our house.
